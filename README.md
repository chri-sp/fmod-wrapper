# FMOD Wrapper

An FMOD wrapper developed for the Sound Programming course during the Master in Computer Game Development at the University of Verona (UNIVR).

The project provides a minimal static library that wraps FMOD Core API for audio functionality: sound loading, playback control, and volume/pan adjustment across multiple audio channels.

## Build Instructions

1. Open `FMODWrapper.sln` in Visual Studio

2. Set `AudioDemo` as the startup project

3. Select the **Debug** configuration and **x64** Platform

4. Build the solution and run `AudioDemo.exe` in `x64/Debug` folder
